//swap(a,b); //why does theirs work????   
 
  myswap(a, b); // but mine doesn't ?!?!?!?!!!???

  //cout<<"a = "<<a<<", b = "<<b<<endl;
  
  //this doesn't work since this function (myswap) is a void function and this doesn't return 
  //maanything so to solve this problem you would print the values inside of the function and the "*" should be taken out of the arguements
